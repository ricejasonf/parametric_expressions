# Parametric Expressions

## Change History

  ### Since R1
    - Added note about declaration syntax and `auto`
    - Added section about *Deducing This*
    - Fixed returning packs by adding postfix tilde

## Abstract

The purpose of this paper is to propose a hygienic macro that transforms expressions during semantic
analysis and template instantiation. This can replace macros in certain cases and enable more idiomatic
code, operations on packs, and have potentially faster compile times versus function templates.

There are two types of transformations, *transparent* and *opaque*, the latter of which supports multiple
statements and cleanups via RAII. Both are hygienically scoped.

Consider the following declaration syntax:

```cpp
using add(auto a, auto b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Here is a function-like declaration that has the same behaviour as a function without creating
a function type, but the body still has its own scope. 

```cpp
int main() {
  int i = 40;
  int x = add(i++, 2);
}

// the same as

int main() {
  int i = 40;
  int x = ({
    auto&& a = i++;
    auto&& b = 2;
    a + b; // result of expression
  });
}

```
> By default each input expression is bound to a variable resulting in evaluation that is consistent with
  normal function call expressions. User controlled evaluation is addressed in *Using Parameters*.

A quick note about the declaration syntax: The `auto` in the parameter list in this paper is being used as a placeholder for a constraint.
Normal parameters are implicitly `auto&&`. With concepts the desired syntax is:
```cpp
using foo(Constraint /*auto&&*/ x) {
  return x;
}

using bar(constexpr Constraint /*auto*/ x) {
  return x;
}
```

Function templates as we have them now are loaded with features such as overloading, constraints,
type deduction, SFINAE, ect.. When called not only do we get an expensive template instantiation but also
potentially large symbols and extraneous code generation all for functions we wouldn't call otherwise
unless we expected the optimizer to inline them out anyways.

With this tool we want to give programmers the ability to allow this inlining at an earlier stage, but
since the inlining is guaranteed and in the context of where it is called we can do things not currently
possible with normal functions without creating a special type for each invocation.

## Constexpr Parameters

Since the invocation is inlined we easily get constexpr parameters without generating a complicated
symbol for a function prototype.


```cpp
using to_int_c(constexpr auto x) {
  return std::integral_constant<int, x>{};
}

int main() {
  constexpr int x = 42;
  std::integral_constant<int, 42> foo = to_int_c(42);
}
```

## Using Parameters

With `using` as a specifier, we allow the user to take control of evaluation with macro-like semantics.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using if_(using auto cond, using auto x, using auto y) {
  return cond ? x : y;
}

int main() {
  if_(
    true,
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << '\n',
    std::cout << "not evaluated so nothing gets printed"
  );
}
```
https://godbolt.org/z/z1bE4y

This has some compelling use cases for creating idiomatic interfaces.

### Customized disjunction with short-circuit evaluation:

```cpp
#include <string>

struct foo {
  std::string value;
  using operator||(auto self, using auto x) {
    return (self.value.length() > 0) ? self : x;
  } 
};

foo x = {"hello"};
foo y = x || foo{"world"};
          // ^ lazily constructed
```
https://godbolt.org/z/AObP4X

### Customized conjunction with short-circuit evaluation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

struct guard {
  using operator&&(auto self, using auto LAZY_X) {
    if (!self.is_stopped) {
      decltype(auto) x = LAZY_X;
      std::cout << x << '\n';
      if (std::string_view(x) == std::string_view("stop"))
        self.is_stopped = true;
    }
    return self;
  }

  bool is_stopped = false;
};

int main() {
  auto g = guard{} && "pass1"
                   && "pass2"
                   && "pass3"
                   && "stop"
                   && "this is not printed";
}
```
https://godbolt.org/z/qnGBZC


### Constexpr ternary expression

We can have an expression yield different types and omit evaluation for the unused alternative.

```cpp
#include <memory>

template <bool>
struct constexpr_if_;

/* ... */

using constexpr_if(constexpr auto cond,
                   using auto x,
                   using auto y) {
  return constexpr_if_<cond>::apply(x, y);
}

auto x = constexpr_if(true, int{42}, std::make_unique<int>(42));
                                  // ^ not evaluated
```
https://godbolt.org/z/SU4EyB

### Debug logging with no evaluation in production (like macros)

```cpp
namespace log {
  struct null_stream {
    using operator<<(using auto) {
      return null_stream{};
    }
  };

  using warn() {
    if constexpr (log_level == Warning)
      return std::wcerr;
    else
      return null_stream{};
  }
}

if (foo > 42)
  log::warn() << "Foo is too large: " << foo << '\n';

```

With these, there is the issue of the author unintentionally duplicating or omitting evaluation of an
input expression. This is the reason for the declaration specifier. Once opting in, the author assumes
the same behaviour and pitfalls as we already expect with preprocessor macros.

## Concise Forwarding

With this feature we can implement a forwarding operator that is more concise than the existing
`std::forward`.

```cpp
using fwd(using auto x) {
  return static_cast<decltype(x)>(x);
}

auto old_f = [](auto&& x) { return std::forward<decltype(x)>(x); };
auto new_f = [](auto&& x) { return fwd(x); };
```



## Friendlier Interfaces

Some people don't like the angle bracket soup that templates can bring when interfaces require constexpr
friendly inputs. Here we can hide it with a simple wrapper (taken from [here][5]):

```cpp
#include "ctre.hpp"
#include <string_view>

using match(using auto x, using auto sv) {
    static constexpr auto pattern = ctll::basic_fixed_string{ x };
    return ctre::re<pattern>().match(sv);
}


int main() {
    return match("Hello.*", "Hello World");
}
```
https://godbolt.org/z/A0J6B4

## As a Member of a Class

Parametric expressions can be used as a member and in conjunction with operator overloading to create an
invocable object:

```cpp
  struct id_fn {
    using operator()(this auto self, auto x) {
      return x;
    }
  };

  id_fn{}(42);

  static_assert(std::is_invocable<id_fn, int>::value);
```

Because `this` cannot be deduced, the first parameter is a "self" parameter initialized with the base
expression.

When declared with the `static` specifier there is no "self" parameter. This can be used for operators too when the base expression is not important.

```cpp
  struct id_fn {
    static using operator()(auto x) {
      return x;
    }
  };

  id_fn{}(42);

  static_assert(std::is_invocable<id_fn, int>::value);
```

> It is recommended to make the "self" parameter's behaviour consistent with [P0847][7].

## Transparent Transformations

Specific conditions allow us to generate an expression that does not require RAII and therefore allows
the compiler to substitute the call expression directly which can also be used in SFINAE and other
contexts where variable declarations and statements are not welcome.

```cpp
using funcify(using auto f) {
  return [](auto&& ...x)
    noexcept(noexcept(decltype(f(std::forward<decltype(x)>(x)))))
    -> decltype(f(std::forward<decltype(x)>(x)...))
    { return f(std::forward<decltype(x)>(x)...); };
}

struct make_array_impl {
  using operator()(using auto ...x) {
    return std::array<std::common_type<decltype(x)...>, sizeof...(x)>{x...};
  }
};

constexpr auto make_array = funcify(make_array_impl{});
```

When a RAII scope is needed these will be referred to as opaque transformations.

> If the difference is confusing then consider an alternative syntax for transparent
transformations that doesn't involve compound statement and return statement syntax. Something like the following:
```cpp
/* Possible alternative syntax for transparent transformations */
using add(using auto x, using auto y) = x + y;
                                   // ^ note the assignment like syntax
```


## Operations on Parameter Packs

The ability to return a pack can reduce the need for additional helper functions for things like
unpacking index sequences or tuples. This proposal uses a postfix tilde `~` to declare and call
parametric expressions returning unexpanded parameter packs.

```cpp
{
  int sum = (int_seq~(5) + ...);
}
{
  std::array<int, 5> xs = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int sum = (xs[int_seq~(5)] + ...);
}
{
  int xs[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int sum = (xs[int_seq~(5)] + ...);
}
{
  constexpr std::tuple xs{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  constexpr int sum = (unpack~(xs) + ...);
}
```

Since a parametric expression must either return a pack or not return a pack, and any call expression
must know this even if the name is dependent, we must add a marker to the call site and declaration.
For the case of returning a pack, a postfix tilde after the name is used:

```cpp
using to_pack~(using auto ...x) {
  return x;
      // ^-- must be unexpanded pack
}

int main() {
  int sum = (to_pack~(0, 1, 2, 3) + ...);
  //         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this is a pack
}
   
```

Additionally, this paper proposes a unary postfix tilde operator that is implemented as a parametric expression.

```cpp
struct foo {
  int member1;
  int member2;

  using operator()~(auto self) {
    return to_pack~(fwd(self).member1,
                    fwd(self).member2);
  }
};
  
foo xs = {4, 2};
assert((xs~ + ...) == 6);
       // ^ unary postfix tilde expands to pack
```
> Note that here `self` is a bound parameter to avoid duplicate evaluation. For pack operations this variable would have to be bound to the calling scope. (so it can't be used in the translation unit)

> The name `operator()~` for the declaration syntax was chosen as it prevents ambiguity with normal prefix `operator~`. Since overloading is not allowed `operator~(self, int)` is not possible.

Currently the postfix tilde implementation is a work in progress, but you can still try it out without
the marker: [https://godbolt.org/z/Zo9ozy][4]

The idea for using a postfix tilde comes from Arthur O`Dwyer's blog post [_Packs of packs_][6]. In it he describes an ambiguity with packs of packs. For example:

```cpp
  template <typename ...Pack>
  void foo() {
    (Pack::get_pack~(), ...);
  // ^-------------^-- how do these expand?
  }
```

To prevent this ambiguity we disallow operands containing unexpanded parameter packs. This must include checking the callee of non-member call expressions.

## Comparison with Other Proposed Features

One of the primary benefits of this proposed feature is the compile-time performance and
the fact that it has zero impact on the type system. That with operations on packs, there are no other
proposals addressing this. However this proposed feature does have overlap with other proposed features
concerning constexpr parameters and conditional evaluation.

The paper *`constexpr` Function Parameters* [(P1045R1)][1] by David Stone proposes the `constexpr`
specifier be allowed in normal function parameter declarations effectively making the parameter
`constexpr`. The advantage that it has over this Parametric Expressions proposal is that it allows
function overloading. While this is still highly desirable, it comes with a few costs which will affect
compiler throughput. First, it requires overload resolution to check if an argument expression can be
used in a constant expression. Second, each constexpr parameter would affect the type creating a new
function type with symbols that would have to be similar to anonymous classes for each permutation of
input arguments. If this is deemed feasible, there is no conflict and the `constexpr` parameters proposed
by this paper are consistent with David Stone's proposal and the feature proposed in this paper would be
a useful augment for when overloading is not needed.

The paper *Towards A (Lazy) Forwarding Mechanism for C++* [(P0927R0)][2] by James Dennet and Geoff Romer
specifically sets out to add a feature to enable conditional evaluation of function parameters. The paper
suggests the use of syntax similar to a lambda expression for the parameter declaration to specify
laziness of evaluation which is a major shift in convention as far as variable declarations are
concerned. This paper is in agreement with the motiviations stated, but the solutions are in contrast.
Having the same issues with creating a function prototype, the paper addresses the implications on the
type system suggesting that lazy parameters be added to the type system which is high impact, complex, and
in the opinion of this paper, unnecessary. This paper, however, is proposing the use of an existing
keyword in the declaration specifier which is more in keeping with existing conventions with parameter
declarations, and there is no impact on the type system which makes it a better solution.

### Deducing This

The paper *Deducing This* [P0847][7] introduces a means for deducing the type and qualifiers for `this`
which eliminates requiring users to create duplicate overloads for const, non-const, and different
reference types. This is great. Since parametric expressions do not have overloading it must deduce the
type of the base expression so it copies the idea of using the first parameter as P0847 does. To make it
clear to the user that a parameter is a "self" parameter, it is desired that it use the same `this`
specifier in the declaration syntax. At least for non-constexpr and non-using params the behaviour should be
consistent with the `this` parameters specified in P0847 as well (e.g. casting to base class).

In the reference implementation for this paper, `this` is not allowed in the body of parametric
expressions because its type qualifiers and referenceness are not known until instantiation, hence the
need for a "self" parameter.

## Notable Concerns

### Why not go for broke and jump straight into granular AST node manipulation?

Some have suggested that we add something more akin to raw AST generation as is found in Rust macros.
While this would be a powerful superset of the feature this paper is proposing, it comes with some
issues.  One, this would make the interface **significantly more complicated** and inaccessible to
typical users. It also comes with the same problems with evaluation that preprocessor macros have in that
it easily allows mistakes that result in duplicate evaluation or double move operations.

The interface proposed with *Parametric Expressions* is such that it defaults to consistent evaluation of
input expressions by binding them to an actual variable declaration in the parameter list. If the author
of a function wants to take control of evaluation they can do so via the `using` parameter declaration
specifier and thus opt in explictly and without a lot of crazy AST syntax.

That said, the advent of Reflection and Metaclasses may open the door to allowing more refined control
over the AST, and this paper's stance is that this feature is **forwards compatible** with the possibilty
of adding `reflexpr` parameters or some similar construct to enable this superset.

### Invocable and the Dangers of `using` Parameters

As previously stated, `using` parameters add macro-like semantics. While the pitfalls of macros are well
understood, here is an edge case that is worth mentioning:

```cpp
struct eval_twice_fn {
  using operator()(using auto x) {
    return std::pair(x, x);
  }
} inline constexpr eval_twice{};

auto result1 = eval_twice(my::string("foo"));
auto result2 = std::invoke(eval_twice, my::string("foo"));
```

Here the semantics are changed when used with `std::invoke`. Since `std::invoke` is a normal function, it
evaluates it and binds it to a parameter that is perfectly forwarded. The forwarding expression would
then be passed to `eval_twice` and the result of the input would get moved twice. With the call
expression the result is a pair of two distinct strings containing a pointer to their own "foo".

`std::Invokable` does not require that the call to `std::invoke` be equality preserving on its arguments
so this is likely permissible. Regardless, this paper's stance is to allow these types of edge cases, and
leave it to the discretion of the user as the user is opting in explicitly via the `using` specifier.
Attempts to prevent these would involve complex rules and could inadvertantly rule out desirable use
cases.


## Impact on the Existing Standard

While there is zero impact on existing features in C++, the following additions are required:

1. Parsing the `using` keyword followed by an identifier or operator name followed by a left
   parentheses would indicate the declaration of a parametric expression disambiguating from
   other valid uses of the `using` keyword for other types of declarations.

2. Allow the `constexpr` specifier in parameter declarations in the context of a parametric
   expression parameter list declaration.

3. The `using` keyword is used as a declaration specifier for parameter declarations in the
   context a parametric expression parameter list declaration.

4. The parameter declarations do not specify a type but only a constraint.
  

## Implementation Experience

The proposed language feature has been implemented in a fork of Clang here: [reference implementation][3]

Issues are being tracked here: [Github][8]

From this the following are rules to specify its workings in simple terms:

1. Declaration or invocation does not create a type.

2. The input parameter list may contain only one parameter pack in any position.

3. Input parameters do not specify a type or have type specifiers.
    * The **`auto` is a placeholder for a constraint** which is meant for forwards compatibility with
      language Concepts.

4. Parameter declarations can have `constexpr` or `using` specifiers which change semantics:
    * By default the parameter is a forwarding reference initialized with the input expression
      (like auto&&).
    * The `constexpr` specifier enables value initialization with an expression that must be a
      constant-expression (like constexpr auto)
    * The `using` specifier does not bind the input expression to a variable, but the input expression is
      substituted everywhere the name is used. (like a macro)

5. Parameters that bind to a variable are specified to evaluate in the order of their declaration from
   left to right and before evaluation of the compound statement.

6. There are two types of transformations: *Opaque* and *Transparent*
    * Transparent transformations occur when there are no variable declarations (except `using` vars),
      and there is only a single statement that is a return statement. The resulting expression
      substitutes the call expression that invoked it.
    * When a pack is returned it is a transparent transformation. "Normal" parameters are allowed,
      but they must be bound to the calling scope.
    * All others are opaque transformations and create a RAII scope where their return statements must be
      full expressions. Typical RVO/NRVO rules for return values apply as they do in functions.

7. Transparent transformations may have "parts" of expressions as inputs and outputs.
    * This includes expressions that do not refer to values such as template names and others.
    * An unexpanded parameter pack is allowed as an output but is expanded before input, and it must have
      a marker at the call site (postfix tilde).

8. An Opaque transformation's return statements should follow the same rules for function return type
   deduction via `decltype(auto)`.

9. Recursion is not feasible, but it is possible to achieve with templates and dependent input expressions.

10. Operator overloading is supported along with ADL, and it creates an ambiguous call if there are other
    viable candidates present.

11. When defined as a member of a class, invocations include the base expression as the first parameter.
    (ie a self parameter)
    * The reason for this is that the type is deduced and it is not compatible with the way `this`
      works in function definitions. Also it gives the user flexibility to define the self parameter
      as `using` or `constexpr`.

12. As a member, the static keyword can be used to simply make it a free entity that is local to
    the owning class.
    * This means there is no self param.

13. Operator overloads can be declared as `static`.

14. All arguments must be non-dependent before instantiation. This includes value dependence.

## Summary

With this we have a facility for writing more idiomatic and concise code with operations on packs all
without polluting the call stack or extraneous type generation. Please consider this language feature
for a future standard of C++.


Thanks for looking at this!
