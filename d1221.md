# Parametric Expressions

Try it out: [https://godbolt.org/z/Zo9ozy][4]

## Abstract

The purpose of this paper is to propose a hygienic macro that transforms expressions during semantic
analysis and template instantiation. This can replace macros in certain cases and enable more idiomatic
code, operations on packs, and have potentially faster compile times versus function templates.

There are two types of transformations, *transparent* and *opaque*, the latter of which supports multiple
statements and cleanups via RAII. Both are hygienically scoped.

Consider the following declaration syntax:

```cpp
using add(auto a, auto b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Here is a function-like declaration that has the same behaviour as a function without creating
a function type, but the body still has its own scope. 

```cpp
int main() {
  int i = 40;
  int x = add(i++, 2);
}

// the same as

int main() {
  int i = 40;
  int x = ({
    auto&& a = i++;
    auto&& b = 2;
    a + b; // result of expression
  });
}

```
> By default each input expression is bound to a variable resulting in evaluation that is consistent with
  normal function call expressions. User controlled evaluation is addressed in *Using Parameters*.

A quick note about the declaration syntax: The `auto` in the parameter list is being used as a placeholder for a constraint.
Normal parameters are implicitly `auto&&`. With concepts the desired syntax is:
```cpp
using foo(Constraint /*auto&&*/ x) {
  return x;
}

using bar(constexpr Constraint /*auto*/ x) {
  return x;
}
```

Function templates as we have them now are loaded with features such as overloading, constraints,
type deduction, SFINAE, ect.. When called not only do we get an expensive template instantiation but also
potentially large symbols and extraneous code generation all for functions we wouldn't call otherwise
unless we expected the optimizer to inline them out anyways.

With this tool we want to give programmers the ability to allow this inlining at an earlier stage, but
since the inlining is guaranteed and in the context of where it is called we can do things not currently
possible with normal functions without creating a special type for each invocation.

## Constexpr Parameters

Since the invocation is inlined we easily get constexpr parameters without generating a complicated
symbol for a function prototype.


```cpp
using to_int_c(constexpr auto x) {
  return std::integral_constant<int, x>{};
}

int main() {
  constexpr int x = 42;
  std::integral_constant<int, 42> foo = to_int_c(42);
}
```

## Using Parameters

With `using` as a specifier, we allow the user to take control of evaluation with macro-like semantics.

```cpp
using if_(using auto cond, using auto x, using auto y) {
  if (cond)
    return x;
  else
    return y;
}

int main() {
  if_(
    true,
    print("Hello, world!"),
    print("not evaluated so nothing gets printed")
  );
}
```

This has some compelling use cases for creating idiomatic interfaces:

```cpp
// customized conjunction and disjunction with short-circuit evaluation

Foo* y = x || new Foo();

auto y = do_something() && maybe_do_something_else();

```

```cpp
// constexpr ternary expression

auto x = constexpr_if(true, int{42}, std::make_unique<int>(42));
```

```cpp
// debug logging that eliminates evaluation in production (like macros)

namespace log {
  struct null_stream {
    using operator<<(using auto) {
      return null_stream{};
    }
  };

  using warn() {
    if constexpr (log_level == Warning)
      return std::wcerr;
    else
      return null_stream{};
  }
}

foo > 42 && log::warn() << "Foo is too large: " << foo << '\n';

```


## Concise Forwarding

With this feature we can implement a forwarding operator that is more concise than the existing
`std::forward`.

```cpp
using fwd(using auto x) {
  return static_cast<decltype(x)>(x);
}

auto old_f = [](auto&& x) { return std::forward<decltype(x)>(x); };
auto new_f = [](auto&& x) { return fwd(x); };
```



## Friendlier Interfaces

Some people don't like the angle bracket soup that templates can bring when interfaces require constexpr
friendly inputs. Here we can hide it with a simple wrapper (taken from [here][5]):

```cpp
#include "ctre.hpp"

using match(constexpr auto x, using auto sv) {
    static constexpr auto pattern = ctll::basic_fixed_string{ x };
    constexpr auto re = ctre::re<pattern>();
    return re.match(sv);
}


int main() {
    return match("Hello.*", "Hello World");
}
```

## As a Member of a Class

Parametric expressions can be used as a member in conjunction with operator overloading to create an
invocable object:

```cpp
  struct id_fn {
    using operator()(using auto self, auto x) {
      return x;
    }
  };

  id_fn{}(42);

  static_assert(std::is_invocable<id_fn, int>::value);
```

## Transparent Transformations

Specific conditions allow us to generate an expression that does not require RAII and therefore allows
the compiler to substitute the call expression directly which can also be used in SFINAE and other
contexts where variable declarations and statements are not welcome.

```cpp
using funcify(using auto f) {
  return [](auto&& ...x)
    noexcept(noexcept(decltype(f(std::forward<decltype(x)>(x)))))
    -> decltype(f(std::forward<decltype(x)>(x)...))
    { return f(std::forward<decltype(x)>(x)...); };
}

struct make_array_impl {
  using operator()(using auto ...x) {
    return std::array<std::common_type<decltype(x)...>, sizeof...(x)>{x...};
  }
};

constexpr auto make_array = funcify(make_array_impl{});
```

When a RAII scope is needed these will be referred to as opaque transformations.


## Operations on Parameter Packs

The ability to return a pack can reduce the need for additional helper functions for things like
unpacking index sequences or tuples:

```cpp
{
  int sum = (int_seq~(5) + ...);
}
{
  std::array<int, 5> xs = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int sum = (xs[int_seq~(5)] + ...);
}
{
  int xs[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int sum = (xs[int_seq~(5)] + ...);
}
{
  constexpr std::tuple xs{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  constexpr int sum = (unpack~(xs) + ...);
}
```

Since a parametric expression must either return a pack or not return a pack, and any call expression
must know this even if the name is dependent, we must add a marker to the call site and declaration.
For the marker a postfix tilde after the name is suggested:

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct foo
  static using to_pack~(using auto ...x) {
    return x;
        // ^-- must be unexpanded pack
  }
};

template <typename T>
int bar(T) {
  (foo<T>::to_pack~(0, 1, 2, 3) + ...);
               // ^ this means it returns a pack
                
}
   
```

Additionally, this paper proposes a unary postfix tilde operator that is implemented as a parametric expression.

```cpp
struct foo {
  int member1;
  int member2;

  using operator()~(auto self) {
    return to_pack~(fwd(self).member1,
                    fwd(self).member2);
  }
};
  
foo x = {4, 2};
assert((x~ + ...) == 6);
      // ^ unary postfix tilde expands to pack
```
> Note that here `self` is a bound parameter to avoid duplicate evaluation. For pack operations this variabl would have to be bound to the parent scope. (so it can't be used in the translation unit)

Currently the postfix tilde implementation is a work in progress, but you can still try it out without
the marker: [https://godbolt.org/z/Zo9ozy][4]

The idea for using a postfix tilde comes for Arthur O`Dwyer's blog post [_Packs of packs_][6]. In it he describes an ambiguity with packs of packs. For example:

```cpp
  template <typename ...Pack>
  void foo() {
    (Pack::get_pack~(), ...);
  // ^-------------^-- how do these expand?
  }
```

To prevent this ambiguity we disallow operands containing unexpanded parameter packs. This must include checking the callee of non-member call expressions.

## Comparison with Other Proposed Features

One of the primary benefits of this proposed feature is the compile-time performance and
the fact that it has zero impact on the type system. That with operations on packs, there are no other
proposals addressing this. However this proposed feature does have overlap with other proposed features
concerning constexpr parameters and conditional evaluation.

The paper *`constexpr` Function Parameters* [(P1045R1)][1] by David Stone proposes the `constexpr`
specifier be allowed in normal function parameter declarations effectively making the parameter
`constexpr`. The advantage that it has over this Parametric Expressions proposal is that it allows
function overloading. While this is still highly desirable, it comes with a few costs which will affect
compiler throughput. First, it requires overload resolution to check if an argument expression can be
used in a constant expression. Second, each constexpr parameter would affect the type creating a new
function type with symbols that would have to be similar to anonymous classes for each permutation of
input arguments. If this is deemed feasible, there is no conflict and the `constexpr` parameters proposed
by this paper are consistent with David Stone's proposal and the feature proposed in this paper would be
a useful augment for when overloading is not needed.

The paper *Towards A (Lazy) Forwarding Mechanism for C++* [(P0927R0)][2] by James Dennet and Geoff Romer
specifically sets out to add a feature to enable conditional evaluation of function parameters. The paper
suggests the use of syntax similar to a lambda expression for the parameter declaration to specify
laziness of evaluation which is a major shift in convention as far as variable declarations are
concerned. This paper is in agreement with the motiviations stated, but the solutions are in contrast.
Having the same issues with creating a function prototype, the paper addresses the implications on the
type system suggesting that lazy parameters be added to the type system which is high impact, complex, and
in the opinion of this paper, unnecessary. This paper, however, is proposing the use of an existing
keyword in the declaration specifier which is more in keeping with existing conventions with parameter
declarations, and there is no impact on the type system which makes it a better solution.


## Notable Concerns

### Why not go for broke and jump straight into granular AST node manipulation?

Some have suggested that we add something more akin to raw AST generation as is found in Rust macros.
While this would be a powerful superset of the feature this paper is proposing, it comes with some
issues.  One, this would make the interface **significantly more complicated** and inaccessible to
typical users. It also comes with the same problems with evaluation that preprocessor macros have in that
it easily allows mistakes that result in duplicate evaluation or double move operations.

The interface proposed with *Parametric Expressions* is such that it defaults to consistent evaluation of
input expressions by binding them to an actual variable declaration in the parameter list. If the author
of a function wants to take control of evaluation they can do so via the `using` parameter declaration
specifier and thus opt in explictly and without a lot of crazy AST syntax.

That said, the advent of Reflection and Metaclasses may open the door to allowing more refined control
over the AST, and this paper's stance is that this feature is **forwards compatible** with the possibilty
of adding `reflexpr` parameters or some similar construct to enable this superset.

### Invocable and the Dangers of `using` Parameters

As previously stated, `using` parameters add macro-like semantics. While the pitfalls of macros are well
understood, here is an edge case that is worth mentioning:

```cpp
struct eval_twice_fn {
  using operator()(using auto x) {
    return std::pair(x, x);
  }
} inline constexpr eval_twice{};

auto result1 = eval_twice(my::string("foo"));
auto result2 = std::invoke(eval_twice, my::string("foo"));
```

Here the semantics are changed when used with `std::invoke`. Since `std::invoke` is a normal function, it
evaluates it and binds it to a parameter that is perfectly forwarded. The forwarding expression would
then be passed to `eval_twice` and the result of the input would get moved twice. With the call
expression the result is a pair of two distinct strings containing a pointer to their own "foo".

`std::Invokable` does not require that the call to `std::invoke` be equality preserving on its arguments
so this is likely permissible. Regardless, this paper's stance is to allow these types of edge cases, and
leave it to the discretion of the user as the user is opting in explicitly via the `using` specifier.
Attempts to prevent these would involve complex rules and could inadvertantly rule out desirable use
cases.


## Impact on the Existing Standard

While there is zero impact on existing features in C++, the following additions are required:

1. Parsing the `using` keyword followed by an identifier or operator name followed by a left
   parentheses would indicate the declaration of a parametric expression disambiguating from
   other valid uses of the `using` keyword for other types of declarations.

2. Allow the `constexpr` specifier in parameter declarations in the context of a parametric
   expression parameter list declaration.

3. The `using` keyword is used as a declaration specifier for parameter declarations in the
   context a parametric expression parameter list declaration.

4. The `auto` keyword is used as placeholder for a constraint for parametric expression parameters and it
   implictly promotes parameters as `auto&&`. This is more concise but a slight deviation from
   what C++ programmers might expect.


## Implementation Experience

The proposed language feature has been implemented in a fork of Clang here: [reference implementation][3]

From this the following are rules to specify its workings in simple terms:

1. Declaration or invocation does not create a type.

2. The input parameter list may contain only one parameter pack in any position.

3. Input parameters do not specify a type or have type specifiers.
    * The **`auto` is a placeholder for a constraint** which is meant for forwards compatibility with
      language Concepts.

4. Parameter declarations can have `constexpr` or `using` specifiers which change semantics:
    * With none of these specifiers the parameters is an forwarding reference initialized with the input
      expression (like auto&&).
    * The `constexpr` specifier enables value initialization with an expression that must be a
      constant-expression (like constexpr auto)
    * The `using` specifier does not bind the input expression to a variable, but the input expression is
      substituted everywhere the name is used. (like a macro)

5. Parameters that bind to a variable are specified to evaluate in the order of their declaration from
   left to right and before evaluation of the compound statement.

6. There are two types of transformations: *Opaque* and *Transparent*
    * Transparent transformations occur when there are no variable declarations (except `using` vars),
      and there is only a single statement that is a return statement. The resulting expression
      substitutes the call expression that invoked it.
    * All others are opaque transformations and create a RAII scope where their return statements must be
      full expressions. Typical RVO/NRVO rules for return values apply as they do in functions.

7. Transparent transformations may have "parts" of expressions as inputs and outputs.
    * This includes expressions that do not refer to values such as template names and others.
    * An unexpanded parameter pack is allowed as an output but is expanded before input, and it must have
      a marker at the call site (postfix tilde).

8. An Opaque transformation's return statements should follow the same rules for function return type
   deduction via `decltype(auto)`.

9. Recursion is not feasible, but it is possible to achieve with templates or dependent input
    expressions.

10. Operator overloading is supported along with ADL, and it creates an ambiguous call if there are other
    viable candidates present.

11. When defined as a member of a class, invocations include the base expression as the first parameter.
    (ie a self parameter)
    * The reason for this is that the type is deduced and it is not compatible with the way `this`
      works in function definitions. Also it gives the user flexibility to define the self parameter
      as `using` or `constexpr`.

12. As a member, the static keyword can be used to simply make it a free entity that is local to
    the owning class.
      * This means there is no self param.

13. Operator overloads can be declared as `static`.

## Summary

With this we have a facility for writing more idiomatic and concise code with operations on packs all
without polluting the call stack or extraneous type generation. Please consider this language feature
for a future standard of C++.


Thanks for looking at this!
