Parametric Expressions are a hygienic macro like language feature proposed for C++.

Check it out! [P1221](https://github.com/ricejasonf/parametric_expressions/blob/master/d1221.md)

### Play

In addition to the tests in `./play` you can try out the reference implementation on Compiler Explorer
[here](https://godbolt.org/z/Zo9ozy).

You can also use [CppDock](https://github.com/ricejasonf/cppdock) to build the compiler in a docker container in `./toolchain`.

There are also compile-time benchmarks that can be built found in `./metabench`. Results will be posted on the [Blog]().
